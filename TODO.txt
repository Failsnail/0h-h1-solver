move all the testing functions to a namespace where they are free functions
    try to make the interface of the namespace clear by providing a header file with function defenitions
    DON'T put the functions operating on arrays in the public interface! (are only to be used internally by other functions in the namespace)
test the testing functions a lot
make a simple input method
hack a solver (recursive!) to test everything
test everything a lot
